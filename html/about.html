            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student pursuing a Minor in Management and Society and a Certificate in Entrepreneurial
                Thinking at the University of Calgary.
                <br/>
                <br />
                I am a research associate at the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering, conducting independent and collaborative 
                research on optimizing software engineering education, training, and best practices.
                <br/>
                <br />
                In addition to my studies and research projects, I am the Co-President of Tech Start UCalgary, a student driven club
                which focuses on software development and entrepreneurship at the University of Calgary.
                <br/>
                <br />
                I recently completed my 16-month Software Engineering internship at Pason Systems, where I applied and improved my skills in 
                full-stack and all aspects of software development and deployment. I am excited to be returning as a full-time Software
                Developer at Pason after completing my Bachelor studies in May 2023!

            <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Tehran, Iran. My family immigrated to Canada when I was 8 years old. We lived in Toronto, Ontario for 5 
                years before moving to Calgary! 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Coming from a Persian background and household, I am very passionate about sharing my knowledge of our food and ancient 
                Persian medicine.
