                Persian traditional medicine is one of the most ancient forms of traditional medicine.
                The practice and study of medicine in Persia has a long and prolific history. The Iranian academic centers like
                Gundeshapur University (3rd century AD) were a breeding ground for the union among great scientists from different
                civilizations. These centers successfully followed their predecessors’ theories and greatly extended their
                scientific research through history. Persians were the first establishers of the modern hospital system.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Persian traditional medicine is grounded in the concept of four humors: phlegm (Balgham), blood (Dam), yellow bile (Ṣafrā') and black bile
                (Saudā'). The four humors concept is based on the teachings of Rhazes and Avicenna into an elaborate medical system. Different ratios of these 
                groups of material in the body form the four essential temperaments which explain the excess or lack of warmness and humidity in our bodies. In 
                Persian culture, everything has a temperament; this includes your organs, the seasons, colors, and even food!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For example, if you are a mixture of Phlegmatic and Sanguine Temperaments (hot damp/moist), you will need to be choosing foods that
                are cooling and drying such as beef, pork, and sour fruits. A Choleric Temperament on the other hand will be affected adversely by 
                hot and dry foods such as chicken, and chickpeas, eggs, and least affected by cold and damp foods. During summertime, a Choleric
                Temperament needs to be eating cooling foods, as they will become quickly imbalanced if they are eating hot foods. Therefore, it is important
                to understand your individual Temperament!
